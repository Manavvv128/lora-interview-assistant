Q: What is overfitting in machine learning?
2. Explain the concept of underfitting in machine learning

Overfitting occurs when the model is trained on a small portion of the data, resulting in a model that performs well on the training data but not on the test data. Underfitting occurs when the model is trained on a large portion of the data, resulting in a model that performs well on the training data but

Q: Difference between bagging and boosting?
1. Bagging: Bagging is a technique used in supervised learning where the training data is divided into k subsets, each containing a subset of the training data. The model is trained on each subset separately, and the final model is obtained by combining the predictions from all the subsets.

2. Boosting: Boosting is a technique used in unsupervised learning where

Q: What is cross validation?
Question: Can you explain the difference between cross-validation and k-fold cross-validation?

Answer: Cross-validation and k-fold cross-validation are two different techniques used for cross-validation. Cross-validation is a technique used to estimate the variance of the estimator, while k-fold cross-validation is used to estimate the variance of the estimator for a specific

Q: Explain bias vs variance.
Bias:
Bias is a term used to describe the tendency of a model to overfit the training data. This means that the model tends to predict the same outcome for the same input for a given training data point. This can lead to poor generalization performance.

Variance:
Variance is a term used to describe the tendency of a model to underfit

Q: What is regularization?
Question: Can you explain the difference between regularization and regularization parameter in machine learning?

Answer: Regularization is a technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting, which is the phenomenon where the model learns too much information about the data. Regularization helps to prevent overfitting by adding a penalty term to the loss function. In contrast, regularization

Q: How does dropout work?
2. Dropout: A technique used in machine learning to prevent overfitting by randomly dropping some of the training data.

Q: What is the difference between L1 and L2 loss?
Based on the text material, what is the purpose of the L1 and L2 losses in the model?

Answer: The purpose of the L1 and L2 losses in the model is to penalize the model for overfitting and underfitting. The L1 loss encourages the model to learn a simpler representation of the data, while the L2 loss encourag

Q: What is a hash table collision?
A hash table collision occurs when the same key is used to store multiple values.

Example:
Suppose we have a hash table with 100 keys and 100 values. If we insert a key with a value of 10, the hash function will map it to the first position in the hash table. If we then insert a key with a value of

Q: What is normalization vs standardization?
Brief explanation: Normalization is a process of transforming data into a standardized format, while standardization is a process of transforming data into a standardized format. Normalization is used to make data more manageable and easier to analyze, while standardization is used to ensure that data is consistent and uniform across different systems.

Example: A bank might use normalization to
